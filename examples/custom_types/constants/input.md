Rust has two different types of constants which can be declared in any scope
including global. Both require explicit type annotation:

* `const`: An unchangable value (the common case).
* `static`: A possibly `mut`able variable with [`'static`][static] lifetime.

One special case is the `"string"` literal. It can be assigned directly to a
`static` variable without modification because it's type signature:
`&'static str` has the required lifetime of `'static`. All other reference
types must be specifically annotated so that they fulfill the `'static`
lifetime. This may seem minor though because the required explicit annotation
hides the distinction.
