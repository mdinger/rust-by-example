Any program requires comments and indeed Rust supports
a few different varieties:

* Regular comments:
 - `// Line comments which go to the end of the line.`
 - `/* Block comments which go to the closing deliminator. */`
* *Doc comments* which are parsed into HTML library
[documentation][docs]:
 - `/// Generate library docs for the following item.`
 - `!// Generate library docs for the enclosing item.`

{comment.play}
