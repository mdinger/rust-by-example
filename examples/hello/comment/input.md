Comments are a necessary part of any serious program, and most non-serious
programs as well.

There are two ways to write comments in Rust, "block" (`/**/`) and "line"
(`//`). However, the [Rust style guide][2] recommends only using the second.
There are also "Doc" comments, used for documentation.
