Where vectors store values by an integer index, `HashMap`s store values by key. 
`HashMap` keys can be booleans, integers, strings, 
or any other type that implements the `Eq` and `Hash` traits. 
More on this in the next section.

Like vectors, `HashMap`s are growable, but HashMaps can also shrink themselves 
when they have excess space. 
You can create a HashMap with a certain starting capacity using 
`HashMap::with_capacity(uint)`, or use `HashMap::new()` to get a HashMap 
with a default initial capacity (recommended).

(sometimes called hash tables) work, have a look at
